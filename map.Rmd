Our objective is to generate a visual representation of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater across various Wastewater Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) in New York City.

The first part of the code involves data loading and cleaning. For the WRRF information data, relevant columns are selected and prepared for further analysis. Abbreviations for WRRF names are established for convenient reference. Concentration data is also loaded and cleaned, and the two datasets are merged based on the WRRF abbreviation. In the merged dataset, date information is separated into day, month, and year columns, and the dataset is filtered to drop rows with missing concentration values. 

```{r}
map <-
  map_df %>% 
  leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  addCircleMarkers(
             lng = ~lon_wwtp,
             lat = ~lat_wwtp,
             radius = 7,
             stroke = TRUE,
             fillOpacity = 0,
             color = "skyblue",
             popup = ~paste(sep = "<br/>",
                            "<b>", wrrf_name,
                            "</b><br>Mean Concentration:", avg_conc_area, "(N1 Copies/L)")) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)

map
```

<br />

A map is constructed using the Leaflet package. Initially, the average concentration for each WRRF is aggregated for the years 2021 and 2022, considering only data from the "RT-qPCR" technology. The original dataset is then left-joined with this summary data based on the WRRF name.

The Leaflet map is generated using the resulting dataframe, featuring tiles from the CartoDB Positron map as a base layer. Circle markers are incorporated to denote each WRRF's geographical location, and the radius and color of the circles are adjusted for enhanced visualization. Popup information is included, showcasing the WRRF name and the mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (N1/L).

The map offers an vivid depiction of the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations across different WRRFs in New York City, allowing for visual distinctions among areas with higher or lower concentrations, and the popup information facilitates more detailed insights into specific WRRFs.
